## Types of plugin
There are three types of plugin:	
* The built-in ones. These ones come with the extention when you install it.
* The verified ones. These are made my people other than me, but I verify that they aren't viruses.
* Non-verified plugins. You can load unnoficial non-verified plugins from source code. ***_`IF YOU DON'T TRUST THE DEVELOPER AND THE PLUGIN, DON'T INSTALL IT! THESE PLUGINS CAN CONTAIN VIRUSES AND MALICOUS SOFTWARE AND CAN TAKE CONTROLL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS`_***
