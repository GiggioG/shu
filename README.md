# shu
A chrome extention that introduces an API that enables developers to make utility plugins for [JitsiMeet](https://meet.jit.si) based systems like [Shkolo](https://shkolo.bg)'s virtual school.


## Types of plugin
There are three types of plugin:	
* The built-in ones. These ones come with the extention when you install it.
* The verified ones. These are made my people other than me, but I verify that they aren't viruses.
* Non-verified plugins. You can load unnoficial non-verified plugins from a link or from source code. ***_`IF YOU DON'T TRUST THE DEVELOPER AND THE PLUGIN, DON'T USE IT! NON-VERIFIED PLUGINS CAN BE MALICOUS AND CAN TAKE CONTROLL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS`_***

## About
The name comes from SHkoloUtilities, because I started the project in the summer of 2020 after the start of online school for [Shkolo](https://shkolo.bg)'s virtual school. I first started an extension that allowed people to communicate by pulsing their microphone in a pattern somewhat resembling morse code. After that failed, I decided to make an API for the virtual school platform. I worked on it the whole summer, but at the beggining of the 2020/2021 school year I got the news that the whole country is switching to MS Teams. I abandoned SHU for a little more than a year, and now, in October of 2021 I plan on reviving the project. I will rewrite the whole thing, but I want to finish it this time. Developement will go slow this school year, because it's a busy one not just for me, but for all people my age in my country.
> EDIT: Yeah, I defenetely won't be doing anything on this project this school year. - 20.1.2022
