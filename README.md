# shu
A chrome extention that introduces an API that enables developers to make utility plugins for [meet.jit.si](Jitsi Meet) based systems like [shkolo.bg](Shkolo)'s virtual school.
The name comes from SHkoloUtilities.
There are three types of plugin:
* The built-in ones. These ones come with the extention when you install it.
* The verified ones. These are plugins made by other people, that I have verified that aren't a virus. They require installation.
* Non-official plugins. You can load unnoficial non-verified plugins from source code. 

***_`IF YOU DON'T TRUST THE DEVELOPER AND THE PLUGIN, DON'T INSTALL IT! THESE PLUGINS CAN CONTAIN VIRUSES AND MALICOUS SOFTWARE AND CAN TAKE CONTROLL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS`_***
